## Motivation

One of our classmates was interested in self-improvement and had seen application on the app store with a similar concept. However, the apps didn't integrate gamification with self-improvement, so combining the two made sense. 

## Result

Using JavaScript, jQuery, front-end styling, the YouTube and They Said So APIs, and Firebase, we allow users to target specific areas of self-improvement that they want to work on.

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges that we encountered was using git merging and branches for the first time. We had to learn to stop being afraid of using git, and make it our friend. 

## Improvements

In the future, we can integrate more categories and more cards. We can also integrate a user page with some options for the user to allow push notifications and see an overview of their progress. 

## Lessons Learned

We are in our learning phase and this is my fourth clone, so faced multiple issues to build this site. These are some topic that challenges us to make this:-
- Playing with animation to get desired output
- Using javascript to manipulate the features
- Making custom features
- Using various styling method so that our clone could look as original as possible
